This is a project I am working on for fun whenever I have some downtime away from school and work.
I have added in empty functions with FIXMEs of features I would like to add in the future.

As of 11/29/16 this program can:

Deal and add cards to both dealer and player
"hit" to draw another card
Display total sum of hand for both dealer and player
Recognize if your hand is equal to or greater than 21 and will end the game
Stand to end the players turn (currently standing will just reveal the dealers down card and end your turn)

Known bugs:
Sometimes the players cards will be drawn onto the canvas in the wrong order. (the first card will be drawn over the second card)
