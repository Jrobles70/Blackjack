This is a project I am working on for fun whenever I have some downtime away from school and work.
I have added in empty functions with FIXMEs of features I would like to add in the future.

As of 1/15/17 this program can:

Deal and add cards to both dealer and player
"hit" to draw another card
Display total sum of hand for both dealer and player
Recognize if your hand is equal to or greater than 21 and will end the game
Stand to start dealers turn
Recognize if it is or is not your turn and will not let you make moves you cant normally (hitting while the dealer is going)

Known bugs:
Sometimes the players cards will be drawn onto the canvas in the wrong order. (the first card will be drawn over the second card)
Every now and then the alert message that tells the player it is not their turn will appear. I have not found a pattern to when this happens so 
	I am looking into it still. I know for a fact it has to do with the booleans I used to track whos turn it is and when you can do things but I am not sure why.
